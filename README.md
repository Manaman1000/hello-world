# hello-world
My name is Tyler. I am a grad student in math that wants to do analytics and data science for video games so badly that I am going to not only switch from a Ph.D. to a masters.
No, I am going to try and learn Python, create a portfolio of projects, and become proficient enough (as far as one can hope) in the desired skills companies like Blizzard, Riot, Valve, and many others value so much so, that when I graduate, I will be able to be hired by one of them.
This is not going to be easy, but this is what I need to do. i've always needed to do this but I never was honest with myself. I never believed I could pursue this dream and actually obtain it.
But if I can pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics while not being 100% driven in my heart, then I absolutely can do something I've wanted to do my whole life.

We've all started from nothing somewhere, and this is where I begin.
